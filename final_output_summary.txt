Early life
Lineage and childhood
Alexander III was the son of the erstwhile king of Macedon, Philip II, and his fourth wife, Olympias. Olympias was his principal wife for some time, likely because she gave birth to Alexander. Several legends surround Alexander's birth and childhood. On the day Alexander was born, Philip was preparing a siege on the city of Potidea on the peninsula of Chalcidice. That same day, Philip received news that his general Parmenion had defeated the combined Illyrian and Paeonian armies. It was also said that on this day, the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, burnt down. This led Hegesias of Magnesia to say that it had Alexander was raised by a nurse, Lanike, sister of Alexander's future general Cleitus the Black. He was tutored by Leonidas, a relative of his mother, and by Lysimachus of Acarnania. He learned to read, play the lyre, ride, fight, and hunt. Alexander named a city after him, Bucephala. nder as far as India. 

Early life
Education
Alexander was tutored by Aristotle at Mieza. The Temple of the Nymphs was used as a classroom. Aristotle taught Alexander about medicine, philosophy, morals, religion, logic and art. Alexander was able to quote Euripides from memory. He was also acquainted with Persian exiles at the Macedonian court. This gave the court a good knowledge of Persian issues. 

Heir of Philip II
Regency and ascent of Macedon
Alexander was the son of Philip II of Macedon. At the age of 16, Alexander's education under Aristotle ended. He was left in charge as regent and heir apparent. Philip and his army joined his son in 338 BC, and they marched south through Thermopylae, taking it after stubborn resistance from its Theban garrison. They went on to occupy the city of Elatea, only a few days' march from both Athens and Thebes. During this turmoil, the Illyrians invaded Macedonia, only to be repelled by Alexander. Philip and Alexander defeated the Thebans at Chaeronea. They then marched into the Peloponnese. When they reached Sparta, they were refused, but did not resort to war. At Corinth, Philip established a "Hellenic Alliance"  (i.e. ague of Corinth), and announced his plans to attack the Persian Empire. 

Heir of Philip II
Exile and return
Philip fell in love with and married Cleopatra Eurydice in 338 BC. The marriage made Alexander's position as heir less secure, since any son of Cleo would be a fully Macedonian heir. Alexander was only half-Macedonian. Alexander fled Macedon with his mother in 337 BC. He sought refuge with one or more Illyrian kings. He was treated as a guest, despite having defeated them in battle a few years before. Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir. Alexander reacted by sending an actor, Thessalus of Corinth, to tell Pixodarus that he should not offer his daughter's hand to an illegitimate son. Philip exiled four of Alexander's friends, Harpalus, Nearchus, Ptolemy and Erigyius. 

King of Macedon
Accession
Alexander I of Epirus was proclaimed king on the spot by the nobles and army at the age of 20. Alexander was the son of Olympias and Cleopatra. 

King of Macedon
Consolidation of power
Alexander had Cleopatra Eurydice and Europa, her daughter by Philip, burned alive. He also had his cousin, the former Amyntas IV, executed. Alexander was advised to use diplomacy to stop the revolts. He mustered 3,000 Macedonian cavalry and rode south towards Thessaly. He found the Thessalian army occupying the pass between Mount Olympus and Mount Ossa. Thessalians awoke the next day and promptly surrendered. Alexander was appointed commander for the coming war against Persia. He also received news of a Thracian uprising. 

King of Macedon
Balkan campaign
In the spring of 335 BC, he advanced to suppress several revolts. Alexander wanted to safeguard his northern borders. He defeated the "Independent Thracians" at Mount Haemus and the Triballi at the Lyginus river. 

King of Macedon
Destruction of Thebes
Alexander razed Thebes and divided its territory between the other Boeotian cities. Thebes cowed Athens, leaving all of Greece temporarily at peace. Alexander then set out on his Asian campaign, leaving Antipater as regent. 

Conquest of the Achaemenid Persian Empire
Asia Minor
Philip II of Macedon was the leader of a league which was to wage a campaign against the Persians. He sent Parmenion, with Amyntas, Andromenes and Attalus, and an army of 10,000 men into Anatolia to make preparations for an invasion. The Greek cities on the western coast of Anatolia revolted until the news arrived that Philip had been murdered and had been succeeded by his young son Alexander. The Macedonians were demoral 20 ships with crews numbering 38,000[61] drawn from Macedon and various Greek city-states, mercenaries, and feudally raised soldiers from Thrace, Paionia, and Illyria. He showed his intent to conquer the entirety of the Persian Empire by throwing a spear into Asian soil and saying he accepted Asia as a gift from the gods. This also showed Alexander's eagerness to fight, in contrast to his father's preference for diplomacy. Alexander left the government of Caria to a member of the Hecatomnid dynasty, Ada, who adopted Alexander. Alexander proceeded into mountainous Lycia and the Pamphylian plain, asserting control over all coastal cities to deny the Persians naval bases. At Termessos, Alexander humbled but did not storm the Pisidian city. 

Conquest of the Achaemenid Persian Empire
The Levant and Syria
Alexander defeated Darius at Issus in 333 BC. Darius fled the battle, leaving behind his wife, two daughters, his mother Sisygambis, and a fabulous treasure. Alexander proceeded to take possession of Syria, and most of the coast of the Levant. 

Conquest of the Achaemenid Persian Empire
Egypt
Alexander was crowned in the temple of Ptah at Memphis. He restored the temples neglected by the Persians. Alexander made sacrifices to the gods to legitimize taking power and be recognized as the descendant of the long line of pharaohs. During his stay in Egypt, he founded Alexandria,  to the Egyptian gods. In 331 BC, he left for Asia in pursuit of the Persians.  control of Egypt passed to Ptolemy I (son of Lagos) after the death of Alexander. He founded the P tolemaic Dynasty. 

Conquest of the Achaemenid Persian Empire
Assyria and Babylonia
Alexander defeated Darius at the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC. Darius fled over the mountains to Ecbatana (modern Hamadan) while Alexander captured Babylon. 

Conquest of the Achaemenid Persian Empire
Persia
From Babylon, Alexander went to Susa, one of the Achaemenid capitals, and captured its treasury. He sent the bulk of his army to the Persian ceremonial capital of Persepolis via the Persian Royal Road. He then stormed the pass of the Persian Gates which had been blocked by a Persian army under Ariobarzanes. Plutarch claims that Alexander ordered his men to put out the fires, but that the flames had already spread to most of the city. Alexander immediately began to regret his decision to let the city burn. Curtius claims that he did not regret the decision until the next morning. 

Conquest of the Achaemenid Persian Empire
Fall of the Persian Empire and the East
Alexander chased Darius, first into Media, and then Parthia. The Persian king was taken prisoner by Bessus, his Bactrian satrap and kinsman. Alexander buried Darius's remains next to his Achaemenid predecessors in a regal funeral. Alexander founded a series of new cities, all called Alexandria, including modern Kandahar in Afghanistan, and Alexandria Eschate ("The Furthest") in modern Tajikistan. The campaign took Alexander through Media, Parthia, Aria (West Afghanistan), Drangiana, Arachosia (South and Central Afghanistan), Bactria (North and Central Afghan), and Scythia.  then sued for peace. Then sued for war. then sued again. then won peace. 

Conquest of the Achaemenid Persian Empire
Problems and plots
During the rule of the Achaemenids, the elite positions in many segments of the empire were reserved for Iranians and to a major degree Persian noblemen. Alexander adopted some elements of Persian dress and customs at his court. The Greeks however regarded the gesture of proskynesis as the province of deities and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. Alexander realized that he had to create a central government with or without the support of the Iranians. As early as 334 BC he demonstrated awareness of this, when he challenged incumbent King Darius III. However, Alexander's eventual decision to burn the Achaemenid palace at Persepolis in conjunction with the major rejection and opposition of the "entire Persian people" made it impracticable for him to succeed to the throne. Alexander was the target of two plots against his life. The first was to pose himself as Darius' legitimate successor. The second was instigated by his own royal pages. Callisthenes of Olynthus was implicated in the plot, and in the Anabasis of Alexander, Arrian states that he and the pages were tortured on the rack as punishment. It remains unclear if Callisthene was actually involved in thePlot. 

Conquest of the Achaemenid Persian Empire
Macedon in Alexander's absence
Alexander left his general Antipater in charge of Macedon during his campaign in Asia. Greece enjoyed a period of peace and prosperity during Alexander's campaign. However, Alexander's constant demands for troops and the migration of Macedons throughout his empire depleted Macedon's strength. Macedonia was weakened after Alexander. This led to its subjugation by Rome after the Third Macedonian War (171–168 BC) 

Conquest of the Achaemenid Persian Empire
Coinage
Alexander minted gold staters, silver tetradrachms and drachims, and various fractional bronze coins. The types of these coins remained constant in his empire. Alexander did not attempt to impose uniform imperial coinage throughout his new conquests. Persian coins continued to circulate in all the satrapies of the empire. 

Indian campaign
Forays into the Indian subcontinent
Alexander the Great turned to the Indian subcontinent after the death of Spitamenes. He invited the chieftains of the former satrapy of Gandhara to come to him and submit to his authority. Omphis (Indian name Ambhi), the ruler of Taxila, complied, but some hill clans refused to submit. Taxiles accompanied Alexander in the Battle of the Hydaspes. He was entrusted with the government of the territory between that river and the Indus. Alexander personally led a campaign against the Aspasioi of the Kunar Valley, the Guraeans of the Guraeus Valley, and the Assakenoi of the Swat and Buner Valleys. He was allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself (323 BC) Alexander defeated King Porus in the Battle of the Hydaspes in 326 BC. He appointed Porus as satrap, and added to Porus's territory land that he did not previously own. Alexander founded two cities on opposite sides of the hydaspes river. Alexander dedicated the elephant to the Helios (Sun) and named it Ajax. The elephant had gold rings around its tusks. 

Indian campaign
Revolt of the Hellenic army
Alexander's army mutinied at the Hyphasis River (Beas), refusing to march farther east. East of Porus's kingdom, near the Ganges River, was the Nanda Empire of Magadha. Further east, the Gangaridai Empire of Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent. Alexander was forced to return to Persia in 324. His army had 80,000 horsemen, two hundred thousand footmen, eight thousand chariots, and six thousand war elephants. He conquered the Malhi (in modern-day Multan) and other Indian tribes along the way. Alexander suffered a near-fatal injury when an arrow penetrated his armor and entered his lung. us lost many men to the harsh desert. The tribe survived until the end of the 7th century BC. 

Last years in Persia
Revolt of the Hellenic army
Alexander executed several of his satraps and military governors as examples on his way to Susa. He paid off the debts of his soldiers, and announced that he would send over-aged and disabled veterans back to Macedon. His troops misunderstood his intention and mutinied at the town of Opis. Alexander married noblewomen at Susa, but few of those marriages seem to have lasted much beyond a year. Alexander admired Cyrus the Great, from an early age reading Xenophon's Cyropaedia. He ordered his architect Aristobulus to decorate the interior of the sepulchral chamber of Cyrus's tomb. Alexander organized a banquet for his army to celebrate the end of the campaign of India. He died shortly after Hephaestion. 

Death and succession
Revolt of the Hellenic army
Alexander died on either 10 or 11 June 323 BC, at age 32. He died in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar II, in Babylon. Before his death, someone asked Alexander on who would be his designated successor should he die, he responded: "To the strongest one" Multiple accounts of Alexander's death mention foul play. Diodorus, Plutarch, Arrian and Justin all mentioned the theory that Alexander was poisoned. The strongest argument against the poison theory is the fact that twelve days passed between the start of his illness and his death. Such long-acting poisons were probably not available at the time of Alexander's death. In a 2003 BBC documentary, Leo Schep proposed that the plant white hellebore (Veratrum album) may have been used to poison Alexander. Several natural causes have been suggested, including malaria and typhoid fever. The anguish that Alexander felt after Hephaestion's death may also have contributed to his declining health. 

Death and succession
Post-death events
Alexander's body was laid in a gold anthropoid sarcophagus that was filled with honey, which was in turn placed into a gold casket. While Alexander's funeral cortege was on its way to Macedon, Ptolemy seized it and took it temporarily to Memphis. His successor, P tolemy II Philadelphus, transferred the sarcophagine to Alexandria, where it remained until at least late Antiquity. The tomb was originally thought to have been the burial place of Alexander the Great. It was found to be dedicated to the dearest friend of Alexander, Hephaestion. The sarcophagus of Abdalonymus (died 311 BC) may date from earlier than Abdalonymousus's death. Demades likened the Macedonian army, after the death of Alexander, to the blinded Cyclops due to the many random and disorderly movements that it made. Leosthenes, also, likened the anarchy between the generals, after Alexander's death, to Cyclops. 

Death and succession
Division of the Macedonian Empire
Alexander had no obvious or legitimate heir, his son Alexander IV by Roxane being born after Alexander's death. Alexander's companions asked him on his deathbed to whom he bequeathed his kingdom; his laconic reply was "tôi kratistôi"—"to the strongest" Arrian and Plutarch claimed that Alexander was speechless by this point, implying that this was an apocryphal story. Diodorus, Curtius and Justin offered Alexander IV and Philip III were appointed joint kings, albeit in name only. The infantry, under the command of Meleager, rejected this arrangement since they had been excluded from the discussion. After the assassination of Perdiccas in 321 BC, Macedonian unity collapsed. 

Death and succession
Last plans
Diodorus stated that Alexander had given detailed written instructions to Craterus some time before his death. The successors chose not to further implement them, on the grounds they were impractical and extravagant. The enormous scale of these plans has led many scholars to doubt their historicity.  lexander Romance.[196] "Romance" is a word used to refer to a type of language. 

Character
Generalship
Alexander never lost a battle, despite typically being outnumbered. He used terrain, phalanx and cavalry tactics, bold strategy, and the fierce loyalty of his troops. He also recognized the potential for disunity among his diverse army. Alexander arranged a double phalanx, with the center advancing at an angle, parting when the chariots bore down and then reforming. At Issus in 333 BC, his first confrontation with Darius, he used the same deployment. Alexander personally led the charge in the center, routing the opposing army. Alexander adapted his forces to his opponents' style. He used javelin throwers and archers to prevent outflanking movements, while massing his cavalry at the center. In India, confronted by Porus's elephant corps, the Macedonians opened their ranks to envelop the elephants and used their sarissas to strike upwards. 

Character
Physical appearance
Historical sources give conflicting accounts of Alexander's appearance. Alexander carefully curated his image by commissioning works from famous and great artists. Lysippos's sculpture, famous for its naturalism, is thought to be the most faithful depiction of Alexander. The outward appearance of Alexander is best represented by the statues of him which Ly. e", in the same way sources such as praise poetry are. Alexander was of a fair colour, as they say, and his fairness passed into ruddiness on his breast particularly, and in his face. Apelles, however, in painting him as wielder of the thunder-bolt, did not reproduce his complexion, but made it too dark and swarthy. Alexander Mosaic and contemporary coins portray Alexander with a straight nose, a slightly protruding jaw, full lips and eyes deep set beneath a strongly pronounced forehead. He is also described as having a slight upward tilt of his head to the left. The ancient historian Aelian (c. 175 – c.’235 AD) describes Alexander's hair color as "ξανθὴν" (xanthín), which at the  time, could 

Character
Personality
Alexander's father Philip was probably Alexander's most immediate and influential role model. His mother Olympia similarly had huge ambitions, and encouraged her son to believe it was his destiny to conquer the Persian Empire. Alexander also had a violent temper and rash, impulsive behavior. Alexander was intelligent and quick to learn. He had great self-restraint in "pleasures of the body", in contrast with his lack of self-control with alcohol. He was erudite and patronized both arts and sciences. He sought only the Homeric ideals of honour (timê) and glory (kudos) Alexander's delusions of grandeur are readily visible in his will and in his desire to conquer the world. He appears to have believed himself a deity, or at least sought to deify himself. He began to identify himself as the son of Zeus-Ammon. Alexander adopted elements of Persian dress and customs at court, notably proskynesis, which was one aspect of Alexander's broad strategy aimed at securing the aid and support of the Iranian upper classes. This behaviour cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen. Alexander also was a pragmatic ruler who understood the difficulties of ruling culturally disparate peoples. 

Character
Personal relationships
Alexander married three times. He had two sons, Alexander IV of Macedon by Roxana and, possibly, Heracles of Macedonia from his mistress Barsine. He lost another child when Roxana miscarried at Babylon. Alexander also had a close relationship with his friend, general, and bodyguard Hephaestion, the son of a Macedonian noble. Alexander's relationship with Hephaestion is not known to have been sexual. The pair was often compared to Achilles and Patroclus, whom are often interpreted as a couple. Some modern historians believe that Alexander's youthful relationship was sexual. Alexander impregnated his partners thrice in eight years. He had a higher matrimonial record than his father at the same age. Alexander accumulated a harem in the style of Persian kings. Alexander's mother Sisygambis supposedly died from grief upon hearing of Alexander's death.

The word "glory" is used to refer to a person who has suffered a loss of self-control. 

Legacy
Personal relationships
Alexander's reign marked a turning point in European and Asian history. His campaigns greatly increased contacts and trade between East and West. Some of the cities he founded became major cultural centers. 

Legacy
Hellenistic kingdoms
Alexander's empire covered some 5,200,000 km2 (2,000,000sq mi) At the time of his death, it was the largest state of its time. Many areas remained in Macedonian hands or under Greek influence for the next 200–300 years. 

Legacy
Founding of cities
Alexander founded some twenty cities that bore his name. The first, and greatest, was Alexandria in Egypt. The cities' locations reflected trade routes as well as defensive positions. Smyrnaeans sent ambassadors to the oracle at Clarus to ask about this, and after the response from the oracles they decided to move to the "new" city. The city of Pella, in modern Jordan, was founded by veterans of Alexander's army, and named it after the city ofPella, which was the birthplace of Alexander. Modern cities still named after Alexander the Great include: Alexandria (Egypt), Alexandreia (Greece), 

Legacy
Funding of temples
Alexander the Great donated funds for the completion of the new temple of Athena Polias in Priene, in modern-day western Turkey. An inscription from the temple, now housed in the British Museum, declares: "King Alexander dedicated [this temple] to Athena Polia." 

Legacy
Hellenization
Hellenization was coined by the German historian Johann Gustav Droysen to denote the spread of Greek language, culture, and population into the former Persian empire after Alexander's conquest. Alexander sought to insert Greek elements into Persian culture and to hybridize Greek and Persian culture. The core of the Hellenistic culture promulgated by the conquests was essentially Athenian. Hellenization can be seen in the region of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom (250–125 BC) and the Indo-Greek Kingdom (180 BC – 10 AD) in modern Afghanistan and India. On the Silk Road trade routes, Hellenistic culture hybridized with Iranian and Buddhist cultures. The cosmopolitan art and mythology of Gandhara (a region spanning the upper confluence of the Indus, Swat and Kabul rivers in modern Pakistan) of the ~ Greco-Buddhism is a syncretism of Buddhism and ancient Greek culture. The Edicts of Ashoka mention the Greeks converting to Buddhism. Greco-buddhist kingdoms sent some of the first Buddhist missionaries. The Greek concept of a spherical Earth surrounded by the spheres of planets eventually supplanted the long-standing Indian cosmological belief of a disc consisting of four continents grouped around a central mountain. One Greek king, Menander I, probably became Buddhist, and was immortalized in Buddhist literature as 'Milinda' Ionic influence on Indian art was far-ranging. A few examples of the Ionic order can be found as far as Pakistan. Corinthian order is also heavily represented in the art of Gandhara. 

Legacy
Influence on Rome
Alexander and his exploits were admired by many Romans, especially generals, who wanted to associate themselves with his achievements. Pompey the Great adopted the epithet "Magnus" and even Alexander's anastole-type haircut. Julius Caesar dedicated a Lysippean equestrian bronze statue but replaced Alexander's head with his own. Alexander the Great was used as an example of ruler values such as amicita (friendship) and clementia (clemency) by Roman writers. He was also used as a cautionary tale of how autocratic tendencies can be kept in check by republican values. Caracalla posed as the "new Alexander" since he was his boyhood hero. He began openly mimicking Alexander in his personal style. In planning his invasion of the Parthian Empire, Caracalla decided to arrange 16,000 of his men in Macedonian-style phalanxes. Caracalla visited Alexandria while preparing for his Persian invasion and persecuted philosophers of the Aristotelian school based on a legend that Aristotle had poisoned Alexander. In 39, Caligula performed a spectacular stunt by ordering a temporary floating bridge to be built using ships as pontoons. Alexander's conquests in West Asia and North Africa served as a "precondition" for the later Roman expansion into these territories. Caligula had "no more chance of becoming emperor than of riding a horse across the Bay of Baiae" 

Legacy
Letters
Alexander wrote and received numerous letters, but no originals survive. A few official letters addressed to the Greek cities survive in copies inscribed in stone. 

Legacy
In legend
Many of the legends about Alexander derive from his own lifetime, probably encouraged by Alexander himself. In the first centuries after Alexander's death, probably in Alexandria, a quantity of the legendary material coalesced into a text known as the Alexander Romance. 

Legacy
In ancient and modern culture
Alexander the Great's accomplishments and legacy have been depicted in many cultures. Alexander has figured in both high and popular culture beginning in his own era to the present day. Alexander features prominently in modern Greek folklore, more so than any other ancient figure. In pre-Islamic Middle Persian (Zoroastrian) literature, Alexander is referred to by the epithet gujastak, meaning "accursed" He is accused of destroying temples and burning sacred texts of Zoroastrianism. In Islamic Persia, under the influence of the Alexander Romance, a more positive portrayal of Alexander emerges. The Quran describes Alexander as a heroic figure who built a wall to defend against the nations of Gog and Magog. In Egypt, Alexander was portrayed as the son of Nectanebo II, the last pharaoh before the Persian conquest. The Syriac version of the Alexander Romance portrays him as an ideal Christian world conqueror who prayed to "the one true God" Alexander the Great was revered as a member of the Nine Worthies in medieval Europe. In medieval India, Turkic and Afghan sovereigns from the Iranian-cultured region of Central Asia brought positive cultural connotations of Alexander to the Indian subcontinent. In Hindi and Urdu, the name "Sikandar", derived from the Persian name for Alexander, denotes a rising young talent. Alexander the Great is the subject of many works of art and literature. The Greek Anthology contains poems referring to Alexander. In modern times, Alexander is still a subject of musical and cinematic works. 

Historiography
In ancient and modern culture
Contemporaries who wrote accounts of his life included Alexander's generals Ptolemy and Nearchus; Aristobulus, a junior officer on the campaigns; and Onesicritus, Alexander's chief helmsman. Their works are lost, but later works based on these original sources have survived.
